//         1. Print all even numbers till n.









//         2. Run
//         for(; ;) {
//         System.out.println("Apna College");
//         }
//         loop on your system and analyze what happens. Try to think of the reason for
//         the output produced.






//         3. Make a menu driven program. The user can enter 2 numbers, either 1 or 0.
//         If the user enters 1 then keep taking input from the user for a student’s
//         marks(out of 100).
//         If they enter 0 then stop.
//         If he/ she scores :
//         Marks >=90 -> print “This is Good”
//         89 >= Marks >= 60 -> print “This is also Good”
//         59 >= Marks >= 0 -> print “This is Good as well”
//         Because marks don’t matter but our effort does.
//         (Hint : use do-while loop but think & understand why)
//         BONUS










//         Qs. Print if a number is prime or not (Input n from the user).
//         [In this problem you will learn how to check if a number is prime or not]
